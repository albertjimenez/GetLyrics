# 🎵 GetLyrics (Rust-based Lyrics Fetcher)

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/albertjimenez/GetLyrics)


A fast, reliable, and extensible Rust-based lyrics fetcher.

✨ **New in latest version:**
- 📂 Directory support — process a folder of songs
- 🔁 Optional recursion — --recursive to scan deeper than 1 level
- ❌ **No more web scraping** – cleaner, more stable code.
- 📉 **Smaller binary size** due to removal of HTML parser and scraping logic.
- 🎤 **New `--karaoke` mode** to fetch synced lyrics when available.
- 💪🏻 **New `-f` or `--force`** to redownload an already computed lyric.

📝 After fetching the lyrics, the tool writes them to a `.lrc` file placed next to the input audio file (`.mp3`, `.flac`, etc.).

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Fast lyrics fetching** via [LRCLib](https://lrclib.net) API
- 📄 **Writes lyrics** to a `.lrc` file beside the input song
- 🔁 **Fallback handling** for tracks with slight duration mismatches
- 📂 Process a single file or a full directory 
- 🔁 Optional recursive scan
- 🎤 **Karaoke mode**: get synced `.lrc` lyrics when available
- 🌐 **Blocking HTTP requests** — ideal for CLI and scripts
- 🧩 **Trait-based architecture** for future backend extensions
- 🧪 **Real integration tests**
- 💪🏻**Force creation** to force redownload a lyric that may have not been found in the past
- 📦 Usable as a binary or library
- 🐳 Docker image support for easy builds and usage

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertjimenez/GetLyrics.git
cd GetLyrics
cargo build --release
```

---

## 🚀 Usage (CLI)

Once compiled, run it with an `.mp3` or `.flac` file:

```bash
./getlyrics "/absolute/path/to/song.mp3"
```

Use the `-k` or `--karaoke` flag to request synced lyrics (if available):

```bash
./getlyrics --karaoke "/absolute/path/to/song.mp3"
```

This will extract metadata, fetch lyrics from LRCLib, and save the result to:

```bash
/absolute/path/to/song.lrc
```

---

### 📂 Directory Usage
#### 📁 Process a folder (1 level only — default)
```bash
./getlyrics "/path/to/music_folder"
```

This processes all supported audio formats (mp3, flac) inside the folder but not subfolders.

#### 🔁 Recursive scan of all subfolders
```bash
./getlyrics --recursive "/path/to/music_folder"
```

or shorter:

```bash
./getlyrics -r "/path/to/music_folder"
```
Combine with karaoke:

```bash
./getlyrics -r -k "/path/to/music_folder"
```

## 🐳 Docker Support

The latest version is already available on Docker Hub with two flavours, `amd64` and `arm64`:

```bash
docker pull beruto/getlyrics:0.3.2-amd64
```

Use it like this:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/music beruto/getlyrics:0.3.2-amd64 /music/song.mp3
```

To enable synced lyrics (karaoke mode):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/music beruto/getlyrics:0.3.2-amd64 --karaoke /music/song.mp3
```

> Replace `/music/song.mp3` with the correct path inside the mounted volume.

## 🔐 File Hashing Support

This update introduces **content-based hashing** for all processed files using **SHA-256**.  
The goal is to provide a reliable and deterministic way to detect changes, deduplicate work, and ensure integrity across job executions.


### 🚀 What’s New

- Every file now gets a **SHA-256 hash** generated from its raw bytes.
- Hash comparison is now used to decide whether a file has changed between runs.



### 📝 Example

```rust
let hash_helper = FileHashHelper::new();
let hash = hash_helper.hash_file(&path)?;

// Example: "3fae76b79e531f859bd8cb7e3250e78d637d6ea968a82941e78c0a1ec2c958ef"
println!("SHA-256: {}", hash);
```

## 🧪 Tests

Run real-world integration tests:

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

> These tests make actual HTTP requests to LRCLib.
